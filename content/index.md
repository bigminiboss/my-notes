## > 🗝️ Keys
* Beginner: A technique that can be perfected after 20 minutes of dedicated practice and thoughtful studying
* Intermediate: A technique that can be perfected after 1-3 hours of dedicated practice and thoughtful studying
* Advanced: A technique that can be perfected after 5-10 hours of dedicated practice and thoughtful studying, normally a combination of multiple lower level techniques
* Expert: A technique that can be perfected after 20+ hours of dedicated practice and thoughtful studying, normally a combination of multiple lower level techniques and possibly some adjacent Advanced techniques
* Peak: Techniques coming from someone with well over 100 hours of thoughtful practice that were created out of their intuition. Not attainable or really teachable except for with practice
* Server Latency/Desync: the fact that both players are not 0 ms meaning that each player has a  slightly delayed version of the other player.
* When "less than" is mentioned it is inclusive of a tier
* Player tiers (generally any tier can beat all of those at a lower tier with little to no work, there includes gradients for each tier corresponding to higher and lower ends of the tier):
	* Typical split means the amount of experience not the actual stars (for example, ImVaes is S tier in three gamemodes but is BW Star 200 while I estimated that the equivalent experience would be an 800+ star because he plays a lot of ranked bedwars)
	* F tier: recently downloaded the game has little to no idea on what to do (5-15% of players)
		-- characteristics: slow bridge, no sprint reset, no techniques
		-- typical split: BW Star: 0-100; Duels: Iron; SW Star: 2
	* D tier: mildly better at the game, around 1-2 hours of practice with a mentor (10% of players)
		-- characteristics: may be able to speed bridge, rudimentary sprint reset, no techniques
		-- typical split: BW Star: 0-100; Duels: Gold; SW Star: 3
	* C tier: around 20 hours of dedicated and fruitful study. They are better than D tier as they can now properly sprint reset (60% of players)
		-- characteristics: able to speed bridge, proper sprint reset, beginner and some intermediate techniques
		-- typical split: BW Star: 100-200; Duels: Diamond/Master; SW Star: 5
	* B tier: around 100 hours of dedicated and fruitful study (10% of players)
		-- characteristics: able to speed bridge, proper sprint reset (all methods), intermediate and some advanced techniques
		-- typical split: BW Star: 200-300; Duels: Legend/Grandmaster; SW Star: 7
	* A tier: around 200-500 hours of dedicated and fruitful study (5% of players)
		-- characteristics: able to speed bridge, proper sprint reset (all methods), advanced and some Expert techniques
		-- this is the tier with the most variation. A- will be significantly better than B+ but A is even better than than that gap than A-. Similar with A+ and A
		-- typical split: BW Star: 400-700; Duels: Grandmaster/Godlike; SW Star: 10
	 * S tier: 1000+ hours of dedicated and fruitful study (top 50 players in the world)
		-- characteristics: able to speed bridge, proper sprint reset (all methods), Expert and some or many Peak techniques (some chose to become exceptionally good at certain fundamentals and others chose to experiment)
		-- typical split: BW Star: 800+; Duels: Godlike+; SW Star: 15+

## > How to Practice
* unless specified it is recommended to get used to the movement in a super flat, cheats on, peaceful, saturation (/give player saturation 100000), no structures with wool and shears to get used to the movement and timing of shearing
* only time it would be necessary to practice in game is if the difficulty lies in predicting and cleverness not the actual difficulty of placing the blocks.
* When practicing counters, make sure you realize that they can also counter you this way!
* When practicing, using single clicks is often the preferred beginner method if you are not good at flick as if you accidently place a block extending over the placements and block yourself off it becomes virtually ineffective. Only go for burst clicking when you are very good at the movement already (High B or higher usually) and need to become faster at your level
---
## > 🗼 Pillar/God Method

 --- difficulty: beginner
 --- application: works like a charm on those lower than mid B tier and can be used even on S tier players. Possibly *the* most useful block placement method

![[2024-08-05 17-08-57 1.gif]]
this method is preformed merely by placing a block on the ground and then another on top of it. Then, you should very lightly tap on strafe key and go the other direction. This abuses **server latency** meaning that the other player always sees a delayed version of what's happening (because both your pings are not 0 ms). This makes it so they think you are on the side you strafed to lightly when you are really on the other side leading to flawlesses
### >> 👆 tips
* when placing the blocks it is good to practice by standing still then moving straight forward then at strafe angels (each after the other respectively)
* try to place them as far as you possibly can away from yourself
* don't hold w when you are strafing.
* use single clicks unless you are very good at flicking with burst clicks
### >> 🚫 counters
* sheering the last block can allow you to hit their feet while they are moving
* creating a **middle exit** will effectively make it useless and you can proceed the fight from there
---
## > 🛑 Middle Exit

--- difficulty: beginner-intermediate
--- application: works like a charm on those lower than low B tier and can be used even on A+ tier players. Slightly difficult to consistently pull off quickly and has a very high skill ceiling for application. However, somewhat predictable for mid B tier or higher players who can pretty handily counter it either with **block stomps** or just strafing
![[2024-08-05 12-46-57.gif]]
this method is preformed by extending two blocks off of a pillar or a naturally generated structure then quickly hotkeying to shears and shearing the middle block. This also abuses **server latency** to catch players off guard but it's quite predictable and obvious.
### >> 👆 tips
* stand around two blocks away from the pillar and 1.5 to the right or left of the pillar and flick with single clicks (burst is faster but harder to preform properly).
* starting out you can move a bit backwards to help yourself get the hang of the positioning but most ideally it's done when running towards a naturally generated structure to middle exit through or to quickly do it on a pillar (that is, moving backwards will make it less effective as it's only as good as how quick you can make it).
* This technique is best with baits, if they get used to you constantly middle exiting keep creating it and wait until they are used to that instead
### >> 🚫 counters
* block stomping them right in front can actually lead to the other person getting the flawless instead
* spam clicking the middle block combats server latency and allows the other player to get a hit
* simply moving away and being less aggressive.

## > 🧊👊 Block Stomping
--- difficulty: beginner-expert
--- application: probably one of the highest skill ceiling technique. No real backlash to failure but can be used at a very high level. Beginner level works on less than high D, Intermediate is effective for high D to low B, and Expert can work on anywhere on low to mid A players.
![[2024-08-05 12-52-48 1.gif]]

this method can be preformed by placing blocks right in front of an enemy causes them to have far less momentum, because of **server latency** having more momentum makes you have higher reach (that is because your player is delayed, if you are going faster, then the server thinks you are where you were say a certain amount of time ago but if you travel faster per that amount of time your "true" position is further along, giving you more reach!)

### >> 🏷️Types
![[2024-08-05 12-52-48 1.gif]]
* block spam method: merely spam blocks right in front of the other player and then hit them (normally two as this makes it so they can't just walk out)
	* Difficulty: Uber Beginner
	* works well on less than mid B
![[2024-08-05 17-10-32 1.gif]]
* slash method: the slash method is preformed by having a **pillar** and building a single block adjacent to the second block and one next to the placed block that is on the ground. Ideally an agro player will run into the block allowing for a combo 
	* Difficulty: Uber Beginner
	* Works well on less than low C
![[2024-08-05 12-56-49.gif]]
* candy cane method: the same as **slash** but two blocks out. **Middle exit** with an extra block. Can be used when it hard to move into reach of the last placeable **middle exit** block/to extend the range. Harder to see and thus easier to fall for
	* Difficulty: Intermediate
	* works well on less than mid C
![[2024-08-05 12-57-21 (1).gif]]
* angled candy cane method: the angled candy cane method is the same as the candy cane method except that you place it on the side that the player is attempting to run around the block at to true block stomp leading to much easier combos.
	* Difficulty: Intermediate
	* works well on less than high C
![[2024-08-05 12-59-37 (1).gif]]
* **editing** method: when someone is editing/exiting a middle exit it is good to block stomp them as they are not expecting this block stomp. High skill ceiling as it relies on knowing the other player's playstyle and predicting when they will place
	* Difficulty: Expert
	* works well on everyone can even catch S tier off guard.
### >> 👆 tips
* these methods work well on agro players who have higher ping than you as they will not replace your blocks
* all of these methods require catching the person off guard if you just spam blocks they can easily tell and jump over it, try not to have your blocks in hand if you are spam block stomping and taking them out at the last second and try to only place the blocks as close to as necessary for the others. This can be hard to get right timing wise and cannot be practiced except in game and is ping dependent.
### >> 🚫 counters
* all easily countered by not playing agro

## > 🧑‍🎨 Editing

--- difficulty: intermediate-peak
--- application: works really well on less than high C but after low B it requires a great amount of skill to properly execute without basically just trading

![[2024-08-05 17-15-05.gif]]
Editing is just shearing a block and quickly flicking left, right, or down to replace the block. This abuses **server latency** to make it basically impossible to hit you and you can do chip damage to the other player. This has an extremely high skill ceiling and is mainly what sets apart high A and S tier players because the speed, prediction, and unpredictably are extremely hard to master.

### >> 🏷️Types
![[2024-08-05 13-01-47 (1).gif]]
* a middle exit edit is when you make a middle exit and instead of just exiting you edit it. This can be preformed when they are quite far away and you want to just bait them and make them think your not actually going for a middle exit. After editing a couple of times then strike and walk through. Another method is if you notice that they are a bit too close for comfort so you break the block, hit them, and replace it.
	* Difficulty: Intermediate-Expert
	* Application: most useful against less than low A, but can be used against up to mid A
![[2024-08-05 17-15-05.gif]]
* a wall edit occurs when after a long sweaty match there is an abundance of blocks and you can quickly shear, hit the opponent and flick down to replace the block
	* Difficulty: Intermediate-Peak
	* Application: useful against anyone even #1 ranked elo bedfight
![[2024-08-05 13-04-21.gif]]
* trap wall editing is when you have two diagonally adjacent pillars which you randomly edit through to hit the player on the other side.
	* Difficulty: Expert
	* Application: useful against less than low B
### >> 👆 tips
* The only tip there really is, is to practice. First in a superflat world to get used to flicks and then in games mainly in sweaty fights to learn how and when people do it as well as the most useful applications.
### >> 🚫 counters
* not playing agro, if you are not next to the edit you cannot get hit
* spam clicking the edit block combats server latency and allows the other player to get a hit

--- 
## > 🗼 Tower Edit
--- difficulty: Expert
--- application: works  well on less than low C. Very flashy and good for montages but basically useless (too slow and obvious) past low B

![[2024-08-05 13-08-55.gif]]

tower editing is performed by single clicking a **pillar method**, jumping and pressing s while making a horizontal **pillar** on the top with burst clicks and then making another **middle exit** starting at the second block with a flick and then finally creating a **headhitter**. This can also be done on a natural structure, a premade **pillar**, or the other side of another tower. This is normally used nowadays just to **middle exit** through but is supposed to be used to edit. This **edit** setup is used by shearing the **middle exit**, **block stomping** and then placing a block on top of the block stomp to make an edit and proceeding with wall edits

## >> 👆 tips
* Practice makes perfect! Use the superflat until you get it down
* Generally wouldn't recommend using it on good players as they can all tell what you are doing and just the number of blocks placed means that even the best players cannot do it incredibly fast and in most cases people just make a middle exit LOL
### >> 🚫 counters
* If you know what it looks like, you can really easily counter it by not agroing or block stomping them instead 
* spam clicking the edit block combats server latency and allows the other player to get a hit

---
## > 🔼 Triangle Method
--- difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate
--- application: N/A
![[2024-08-05 17-17-46.gif]]

This method is preformed by placing a block on the ground and placing a horizontal **pillar** on top. This is used for a setup for the tower method against a naturally spawning pillar

---
## > 🐾Grinder Method

--- difficulty: Expert
--- application: certain types work better and other are far more predictable

[insert clip]

this method is preformed by being a block lower than the opponent while blocking off the entrance for them to move forward. There are many techniques to do this but the gist is that once you have them in the grinder you should s tap their feet to kill them.

## > ⚡ Lightning Bolt Exit
--- difficulty: Intermediate
--- application: works well on less than low B (it's quite underground and less obvious).


![[2024-08-05 17-16-10.gif]]
The lightning bolt exit involves placing a block and jumping on it and then looking up one and three to the left or right and placing a block and the burst clicking a horizontal **pillar** before you reach the end of the block and as you are falling flicking your aim upwards to place a final block on top of the horizontal pillar. Then, an exit is preformed through it.

## >> 👆 tips
* works well against a wall. So if you have a wall edit then shear a hole through one side and position the lightning bolt so that it is between you and the opponent and edit through it
* Practicing in a superflat world helps as the most difficult part is doing it.
### >> 🚫 counters
* If you know what it looks like, you can really easily counter it by not agroing or block stomping them instead 
* spam clicking the edit block combats server latency and allows the other player to get a hit
---
## > 🔗 Chaining
--- difficulty: Expert
--- application: works well on less than high C

![[2024-08-05 13-25-23 (1).gif]]

Chaining has a very high skilling ceiling. It refers to the chaining of multiple techniques that are usually not done to completion until the final one to fake the opponent out. For example, a bunch of chaining of middle exits, tower edits, and triangles and then eventual exiting to hit the opponent into a combo

## >> 👆 tips
* Make sure you have a good, full grasp on the arsenal of techniques, the chain is only as good as the weakest link!
* I would recommend chaining things like **Triangle** and **Tower** together to extend a tower or if the other player is quite passive as it can sort of make a wall for you to inch closer to them.
* You can also chain a **Tower edit** ontop of a **Middle exit** as well to similar effects
### >> 🚫 counters
* messing up a single time or even just playing relatively smart can counter this. It's flashy but often too difficult to properly pull off

---
## > 🚫 Middle Exit Plug
--- difficulty: Beginner
--- application: works well on less than low B (it's quite underground and less obvious).

![[2024-08-05 13-26-44.gif]]

A middle exit plug is preformed by noticing where they will likely exit from and plugging the hole with one or two blocks outwards and optionally one or two blocks to the side and on top.

## >> 👆 tips
* I would recommend employing jumping in this technique to get a couple of chip damages in.
* I would not recommend re exiting out of your plug as it is pretty obvious and opponent is already spam clicking so it will circumvent **server latency** advantages
* be thoughtful with this one, if you do it too many times they will start to notice and fake shear blocks
* augmenting it to make it a tower edit can make the battle more edit oriented if that is in your favor
### >> 🚫 counters
* fake shearing a block can easily cause you to place it wrong
* counter jumping will just make you both trade hits
* being too late or of higher ping will sometimes make them not place and lead to you getting flawlessed

## > 🤕 Headhitter PvP

If you have a head hitter and are both going into a fight, do not let them go into the headhitter. This will lead to a trade, instead try to block stomp or middle exit them and head hit them. Why? Because if you are both using headhitters even if you are not both constantly jumping both of your backwards momentums will be stopped by the headhitter causing you both to not take any knockback

---
## > 👆 Useful Gamemodes
These tips are useful in
* Bedwars (pretty useful in solos, doubles, and ranked bedwars but due to limited blocks, geardiff, and spawner restrictions it can be countered)
* Bedfight (useful but if you are playing a good topfight player they can counter it by forcing top fight trades and playing a really long game until one of you eventually wins)
* Fireball Fight (useful here but they can skip if you start block placements so don't let them switch sides with block placements and they can fireball the blocks)
* Ranked Bedwars (all of the best players use block placements!)
* or any other mode with blocks and fast break tools like blitz sg duels

---
## > 4️⃣0️⃣4️⃣ What to do on low blocks?

On low blocks I recommend do not go for edits or towers as they use quite a bit of blocks that could end up not returning to you. Instead simple **middle exits**, **pillars**, and **block stomps** are the way to go. These use the least amount of blocks and as aforementioned they are the most effective and therefore the best bang for your buck

---
## > 🦏 Bulldozing

To bulldoze a player you know that they are playing very annoying so you either go above their block placements (for example if you notice they are setting up a middle exit, towering up a block and jumping on top of it so that you are falling down with your back against the middle exit will cause you to likely win the trade) or you use lower ping to walk through it and initiate a sword PvP if you are confident in top fight

---
## > 🦘 Jumping?
Should you jump over placements? For example, when you make a middle exit or have some structure that is two blocks high is it a good idea to jump and hit the opponent? Oftentimes, no I would say that if the player is even decent (high C or higher) then it will often lead to them playing very, very cautious and annoying. This means they will wait for you to jump and until you start falling to also jump and chip damage you. Jumping should normally only be employed when the other player is known to be generally upwardly stationary and not very good or when you know they will not counter your jump/you yourself countering a jump. When jumping do not continue to hold W when doing so as it will stop your momentum. In fact, you should hold S!

---
## > 🚫 Countering Annoying Players

* Countering jumpers: to counter jumpers, try to always have **headhitters** over your block placements (that is, have your block placements be 3 blocks not 2 blocks high).
* Countering shearers: to counter those who shear your blocks in tandem or instead of you usually leading to a trade, it is a good idea to either know this in advance or notice that they do this. After you know that they will likely preform this, either preform a **middle exit plug** on your own structure or **block stomp** them

---
## > 🫨 Playing Better Players

When you *know* someone is better than you or you realized it, you need to use *gamesense* often players who are good at pvp and block placements are not the best at gamesense (except S tiers). In Bedfight due to the isolation of the gamemode it's almost impossible to win players who are better at pvp and block placements as that is basically what the gamemode is. In Bedwars it's quite easy, getting very very stacked is a good counter and in Fireball fight try skipping them if you notice they are placing a lot of blocks

## > Developing Your Own Playstyle

## > 💪 Finishing words and final tips

So, there you have it! My in depth block placement guide. I recommend familiarizing yourself with the placements and practicing in a superflat world then practicing them in real games. Try them in order of difficulty as I have roughly sorted them in order of what is a foundation for the next. Also, when you notice someone is walking (that is not countering with shears) you should employ things like block stomping (like angled candy cane method) to make sure you hit them unless you are sure you can combo them with exiting and edits. If they are countering with shears it will basically become an edit competition and even if they are mid C tier it can become extremely annoying. In this case try to take a step back and use methods like fireballing, skipping, etc. to "reset." Finally, remember to always be calm, having shakey aim and nerves will make your playing become significantly worse
